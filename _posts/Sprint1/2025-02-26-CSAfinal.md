# Self Grading

| Criteria | Points | Self-Assessment | Explanation / Reasoning |
|----------|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **5 Things Over 12 Weeks** (Issues, Burn Down, Lessons, Presentations, Analytics, Personal Blog) | 5 | 4 | I believe my 5 point list was fine, but when it comes to something that expanses over the 12 week period, I deserve a knock down. I missed this class far too much. |
| **Full Stack Feature Demo** (Highlighting Java and N@tM Feedback) | 2 | 1.7 | I believe that my presentations at DECA were impressive as it took a lot of confidence to present my project to so many people I didn't know, however when it comes to feature I did not update you frequently enough and left you and my product manager in the dark. This is something that I recognize is very important to fix, I can do it in other activities but somehow I forget to do it here. |
| **Key Feature Blog Write-up** (Visualization: drawIO, mermaid) | 1 | 1 | I am proud of this blog as it both explains functionality and technical aspects of my code in a way that is easy to understand  |
| **MCQ / FRQ Work** | 1 | 1 | I completed all MCS and FRQs very well and honestly |
| **Retrospective Quality** (Reflection, Interest in Others, Helping New People, Planning Next Steps, Strengths/Weaknesses) | 1 | 0.8 | Sent you a summary 24 hours in advance, performed practice Live Review, Reflection, honest self-reflection. Missed N@TM so I didn't get to see all the projects that I wanted to. |
| **Total** | 10/10 | 8.5/10 |  |
