[Link to FRQ](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/assessments/assignments/63893227)

## Question 1

Follows all preconditions (like even-length arrays).

Uses simple string methods (substring).

Uses loops and indexing correctly.

Reuses helper method (recombine) to keep things clean.



## Question 2

Checks the precondition: array length > 0.

Uses a loop to find the first peak (element greater than both neighbors).

Reuses helper methods for cleaner code (just like AP wants).

Uses getPeakIndex and checks increasing before and decreasing after the peak.
