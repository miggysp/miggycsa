# My Team Teach Experience 
Overall, doing a team teach, and listening to all the others was a very enjoyable experience. I can see the difference in the level of team teaches compared to last year, as people are going way more above and beyond. I feel far more interested in what my peers are saying and I also think everyone's teaching ability got better too.

Below I have reflected individually on each unit briefly. 

## Unit 1: 
- I learned the constraints of primitive data types, specifically how integers and doubles have maximum and minimum values that can lead to overflow or underflow.
- The coding exercise with the GreatestValue program demonstrated practical implications of integer overflow/ 
- Understanding pass-by-value and pass-by-reference improved my comprehension of Java's memory management, particularly how changes to objects affect references.

## Unit 2 - Self Study: 
- In the Practice: Objects section, I engaged with the concept of objects and their instantiation, gaining hands-on experience through interactive coding exercises.
- I played the groups method golf game, which was fun. 
- I learned about String objects, particularly how they can be created using literals or the new keyword, and how their immutability affects string manipulation.
- I explored escape sequences, recognizing their role in including special characters in strings without syntax errors.
The Key String Methods section emphasized essential functions like length(), substring(), and equals(), which are crucial for effective string manipulation and comparison.

## Unit 3: 
- In the Boolean Expressions section, I learned how to create and evaluate boolean expressions, which serve as the foundation for controlling the flow of programs based on conditions.
- The If Control Flow segment introduced me to the if statement, allowing me to execute code blocks conditionally, which enhanced my understanding of decision-making in programming.
- The If Else section expanded my knowledge by demonstrating how to implement alternative paths in control flow, ensuring that different outcomes can be handled based on specific conditions.
- The Else If construct allowed me to chain multiple conditions together, providing a structured approach to evaluate several scenarios sequentially and avoid deeply nested if statements.
- In the Compound Booleans section, I explored logical operators such as && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT), understanding how to combine multiple boolean expressions for more complex decision-making.
- The Equivalent Booleans concept emphasized the importance of simplifying boolean expressions and recognizing when different expressions yield the same result, which is crucial for optimizing code.
- The Comparing Objects section introduced me to the intricacies of object comparison, emphasizing the use of the equals() method over the == operator to check for value equality, thus preventing common pitfalls in object comparison.

## Unit 4: 

This was my team teach. 

- I introduced the different types of loops: for, while, and do-while, providing clear examples for each type to illustrate when to use them effectively in various scenarios.
- In our discussion on for loops, I demonstrated how to control the number of iterations with initialization, condition, and increment/decrement statements, enhancing the students' understanding of loop mechanics.
- For while loops, we highlighted the significance of the loop's condition, showing how it can lead to infinite loops if not handled properly. I encouraged students to practice identifying potential pitfalls in their own code.
- We also covered nested loops, demonstrating how to use one loop inside another for tasks such as multi-dimensional array processing, which helped students grasp more complex iteration structures.
- I personally created a JavaScript animation to show off the power of iterations in the animation world, creating a ball that moved smoothly across the screen purely through the use of iterations.

## Unit 5: 
- Anatomy of a Class: Discussed the structure of a class, including fields, methods, and access modifiers. Highlighted how classes serve as blueprints for creating objects in object-oriented programming.
- Constructors: Explained constructors as special methods invoked when an object is instantiated. They initialize object attributes and can be overloaded to accept different parameters.
- Accessor Methods: Introduced accessor (getter) methods that allow retrieval of private instance variables. Emphasized their role in encapsulation, ensuring controlled access to an object's data.
- Mutator Methods: Covered mutator (setter) methods that modify private variables. Highlighted the importance of input validation within these methods to maintain data integrity.
- Static Variables: Explained static variables as class-level variables that are shared among all instances of a class. Discussed use cases such as counting instances or maintaining shared states across objects.
- They also had a game at the end for submissions which was cool.

## Unit 6: 
-  I introduced the concept of arrays as a fundamental data structure for storing multiple values of the same type. By explaining their role in organizing data efficiently, students began to understand why arrays are essential in programming.
-  I demonstrated how to declare and initialize arrays in Java, highlighting the syntax and different ways to create arrays. This included both single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, which helped clarify the structure of arrays to students.
- I covered techniques for traversing arrays using standard for loops. Students learned to access each element sequentially, which laid the groundwork for manipulating array data. I emphasized the importance of proper indexing to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
- I introduced the enhanced for loop as a more concise and readable way to traverse arrays. This helped students see how to iterate through elements without worrying about the loop index, making their code cleaner and easier to read.
- We explored common algorithms related to arrays, such as searching (linear and binary search) and sorting (bubble sort, selection sort). Students were able to understand how to implement these algorithms practically, enhancing their problem-solving skills.

## Unit 7:
- Understanding ArrayLists: Explored the concept of ArrayLists as dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size, allowing for more flexibility compared to traditional arrays.
- Creating and Initializing: Learned how to create and initialize ArrayLists, using the syntax ArrayList<Type> listName = new ArrayList<>(); and the significance of importing the java.util.ArrayList package.
- Adding and Removing Elements: Discussed methods for adding elements (add()) and removing elements (remove()) from ArrayLists, emphasizing how these operations modify the list's size dynamically.
- Traversing ArrayLists: Gained insights into different ways to traverse an ArrayList, using both traditional for loops and enhanced for loops, enhancing my understanding of iteration.

## Unit 8:

- Declaring and Initializing: Learned how to declare and initialize 2D arrays in Java using the syntax dataType[][] arrayName = new dataType[rows][columns];. This allowed me to understand the structure and size requirements of multidimensional arrays.
- Accessing and Updating Elements: Explored how to access and update elements in a 2D array using the syntax arrayName[rowIndex][columnIndex]. This helped me grasp the concept of indexing in a grid-like structure.
- Traversing 2D Arrays: Gained experience in traversing 2D arrays through nested loops, enabling me to iterate over rows and columns systematically. This was crucial for performing operations on each element in the array.
- Implementing Algorithms: Reviewed algorithms related to 2D arrays, such as finding the maximum value in the array and calculating the sum of all elements. This provided practical applications for the theoretical concepts learned.

Confidence Score: 9.5/10

## Unit 9 - Self Study:
- Understanding Superclasses and Subclasses: Gained insights into the relationship between superclasses and subclasses, allowing for better code organization and reusability. The distinction between the two concepts was clarified, emphasizing how subclasses inherit attributes and methods from their parent classes.
- Creating Constructors: Learned the importance of constructors in initializing objects. Through default and parameterized constructors in the Shape class, I understood how to define initial values and how they facilitate object creation with specific attributes.
- Method Overriding: Explored how subclasses can override methods from their superclasses to provide specific implementations. This was exemplified through the calc_area() method, allowing each shape to implement its own area calculation while maintaining a consistent interface.
- The super Keyword: Understood the role of the super keyword in accessing superclass methods and constructors. This deepened my comprehension of how to extend and build upon existing functionality while preserving the inheritance chain.
- Class Hierarchies and Polymorphism: Analyzed the structure of class hierarchies in Java and how polymorphism allows for dynamic method resolution at runtime. This reinforced the idea of code flexibility, as a subclass reference can point to an object of its superclass.
