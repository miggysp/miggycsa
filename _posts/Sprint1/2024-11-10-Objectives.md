## [Sprint 1](http://127.0.0.1:4100/miggycsa/2024/09/09/table.html): 
In Sprint 1, my work habits were admittedly inconsistent and less effective than I would have liked. I often struggled with staying focused during class, which led to infrequent code commits and hindered my overall productivity. My tendency to engage in too much conversation during class further distracted me from the tasks at hand and disrupted my concentration. As a result, I didn’t contribute to the project as consistently or meaningfully as I could have. 

## [Sprint 2](http://127.0.0.1:4100/miggycsa/2024/10/09/reviewticket.html): 
In Sprint 2, I made significant progress beyond the practices of Sprint 1, particularly in terms of my commitment frequency. I started committing code more regularly, which helped both with tracking incremental changes and keeping my teammates updated. This shift encouraged a more consistent workflow and allowed for more manageable collaboration. During this sprint, I was also actively involved in my team's teaching process. 

## [Final Evaluation](http://127.0.0.1:4100/miggycsa/2024/11/10/Sprint3reviewticket-copy.html)

In Sprint 3, I genuinely believe I put in my full effort, giving 100% to the project. This dedication was partly due to the group-based nature of the project, which aligns well with my preferred way of working. Additionally, I made a conscious effort to improve my focus in class, cutting down on distractions and staying committed to the tasks at hand. This combination of working within a setting I enjoy and enhancing my concentration led to a significant boost in my performance and contributions to the team.

# Checklist

## Tools Mastery:
During this trimester, I’ve become skilled in using tools like Postman, VSCode, Terminal, GitHub, GitLens, and UML. In my earlier experience with CSP, I had only a basic understanding of these tools, but working intensively with my team this trimester has shown me their true potential, especially when developing API-integrated projects.

My favorite was one I was introduced to during Sprint 1, gitlens. I love how this tool would let me easily navigate through past commits.

# Program Function and Purpose
### Project Purpose:
This project purpose is the productivity of our year computer science classes, and ones after. 

This project is a Seed Tracker application designed to track student submissions and their requested grades. Teachers can enter feedback and grades for each student's weekly activity log, which is stored in a database with unique IDs for each entry. The frontend allows students to submit their name, weekly activity log, and grade request, while the backend manages data persistence and generates unique IDs. This project provides a streamlined way to document and review student progress, with a user-friendly interface and automated backend features to enhance tracking and feedback efficiency.

### Understanding and Development:
Describe how understanding the project improved the ability to develop it.
Inputs: Key inputs include student name, activity log, and requested grade, gathered from the frontend to personalize and manage each student’s weekly entry.

Events: Input submission triggers an event to validate data and send it to the backend, which then generates an auto-incremented ID for new entries, ensuring unique identification.

Outputs: The backend processes inputs and returns feedback, including the auto-generated ID, displayed to the user as confirmation of successful submission.

User Interface Design: The UI is simple and intuitive, featuring a clean form layout that organizes fields for student name, activity, and grade request, with feedback displayed after submission.

Data Definition: Data definitions include id, studentId, name, comment, and grade, each defined in the backend with types and constraints to ensure accurate data handling and retrieval for each student record.

### Individual Coding Knowledge:
Explain personal coding contributions in terms of code segments, functions, and methods.
Show the behavior of the program and how it behaves during execution.

# Sprint 3 Team Issue / Plan
[Team Issue](https://github.com/sharonkodali/seedtracker_front/issues/1)
## Iteration and Improvement
Improvement through iteration:
An example of this was our student page. We had a lot of trouble getting the data to send to the database. We spent hours on call iterating, and testing on postman. This helped us debug the issue.

Questions and Answers:
- How will this change the class from where it is right now? 
It will give our teacher a far more updated view of what everyone is doing on a week to week basis. 

Add a few more questions


Provide your answers to these questions and any additional insights gained.

Demonstration and Interaction:


Reflections and Improvements:
The feedback was overall very positive. One key takeaway I got was that parents like to understand how our code works, while students like to ask how it will help. We began to tailor our answers in a certain way as the night progressed.
