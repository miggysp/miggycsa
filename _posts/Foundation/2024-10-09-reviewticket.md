# Student Teaching - Part 1 Fundamentals

| **Assignment**             | **Points**    | **Grade** | **Evidence** |
|----------------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pull Request (Integration) | 2             | 1.69      | We did our pull request a day late because of bad communication of who would do it, but we recovered my learning from our mistakes and practicing proper communication [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNf5rV0j0XhkXSDBSznv22nOw4ikO172/view?usp=sharing) |
| Relevancy Checklist (Peer) | 2             | 1.80      | Check Utterances    |
| Lesson (Group)             | 1             | 0.90      | Overall our team teach was successful. We presented each topic with fidelity and constantly helped people who needed it. We also had good interactivity. One problem was we were in-speaking a little too much, but we made up for that with my animation. [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fqINLzId4ESL_tMZXzqYBCtfXVn7hyJb/view?usp=sharing)             |
| Homework, Popcorn Hacks    | 1 x 8         | 7.15      | I did all required hacks for every unit along with extra credit hacks for certain units. Those are reflected in my team teach grades. Overall I think I got 0.91 on 2 of then 0.90 on the rest. [Main Blog](https://miggysp.github.io/miggycsa/2024/10/09/teamteaches.html) [Timebox](https://miggysp.github.io/miggycsa/)     |
| Individual Contribution    | 1             | 0.91      | My biggest individual contribution was the animation, which while being interactive and eye catching, still had a aspect of iterations embedded within for the students to learn from.

| Personal Notebooks / Blogs | 1             |  0.90     | I have individual blogs for each unit in my Timebox, as well as a Main Blog where I summarized what I learned from each one and my experience as a whole.

| Work Habits (Analytics)    |   1           |  0.90     | My team teach group was pretty big so I wasn't able to contribute as much as I would have wanted to, however I made up for this by creating an animation so I could have unique contribution.

| Team Planning (Issue)      |   1           |  0.90     | We created a shared google doc with a complete plan of our entire team teach. This made it very easy to take the step into creating the notebooks as we already knew what to write. Animation wasn't planned therefore reflected. [Team Planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmLY5Y8AhCI-ywkJN--SPko2PLmuIy6ZeAN53ms-5Vw/edit?usp=sharing)    |
| Presentation Memories      |   1           |  0.90     |  During our team teach we all bonded over how much better the one we were working on was than the ones we made last year. It perfectly showed how we as CS students have grown from CSP to CSA. We made a group chat that even after our team teach and splitting groups we still use to talk about things.            |
| Grading and Feedback       |   1           |   0.90    | We graded fairly, on the scale that you specified that we should. Meeting expectations perfectly, gave a 0.9. 0.91-2 for extra work and participation, stellar work was 0.95[Grading](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SLxMPSwAvMJ70X8zk0H9UwJXmyqYC2hpS6DJrjmEX2g/edit?gid=988447649#gid=988447649)          |
| Beyond Perfunctory         |   1           |  0.90     |I created an eye-catching javascript animation that visualized the power of iterations [Animation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1peRtnTEDCwplS-UlPHwBCr4ZQjbwe4DX/view?usp=sharing)             | 
| Total                      |   5           |  0.90    |              |
