## [Sprint 1](http://127.0.0.1:4100/miggycsa/2024/09/09/table.html): 
In Sprint 1, my work habits were admittedly inconsistent and less effective than I would have liked. I often struggled with staying focused during class, which led to infrequent code commits and hindered my overall productivity. My tendency to engage in too much conversation during class further distracted me from the tasks at hand and disrupted my concentration. As a result, I didn’t contribute to the project as consistently or meaningfully as I could have. 

## [Sprint 2](http://127.0.0.1:4100/miggycsa/2024/10/09/reviewticket.html): 
In Sprint 2, I made significant progress beyond the practices of Sprint 1, particularly in terms of my commitment frequency. I started committing code more regularly, which helped both with tracking incremental changes and keeping my teammates updated. This shift encouraged a more consistent workflow and allowed for more manageable collaboration. During this sprint, I was also actively involved in my team's teaching process. 

## [Final Evaluation](http://127.0.0.1:4100/miggycsa/2024/11/10/Sprint3reviewticket-copy.html)

In Sprint 3, I genuinely believe I put in my full effort, giving 100% to the project. This dedication was partly due to the group-based nature of the project, which aligns well with my preferred way of working. Additionally, I made a conscious effort to improve my focus in class, cutting down on distractions and staying committed to the tasks at hand. This combination of working within a setting I enjoy and enhancing my concentration led to a significant boost in my performance and contributions to the team.

# Checklist

## Tools Mastery:
During this trimester, I’ve become skilled in using tools like Postman, VSCode, Terminal, GitHub, GitLens, and UML. In my earlier experience with CSP, I had only a basic understanding of these tools, but working intensively with my team this trimester has shown me their true potential, especially when developing API-integrated projects.

My favorite was one I was introduced to during Sprint 1, gitlens. I love how this tool would let me easily navigate through past commits.
