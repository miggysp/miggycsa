### [Go Back to Table](./table.html)
## Challenges: 
- Challenges I faced included: 
Encountering unexpected issues in the code and taking time to identify the source of errors, particularly with GitLens and reverting commits.
- Make not running correctly when I did my python hack
- Getting fluency with JavaScript after a summer of not using it as much. 

## SASS Basics
-SASS allows the use of variables to store common values like colors, making it easier to change them across the whole project.
- Mixins in SASS help you reuse styles for things like buttons or similar elements without writing the same code over and over.
- SASS also lets you inherit styles from one class to another, so you donâ€™t have to repeat code when two elements share some styles.

## Frontend Hacks
- I learned how to integrate a submenu
- I used the dynamics in my about me to create dynamics in the cooking tips and the meal planner.
