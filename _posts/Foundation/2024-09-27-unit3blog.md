## Popcorn Hack 1

``` 
String[]carBrands = {"Audi", "Toyota", "Honda", "Ford", "BMW", "Mercedes", "Tesla", "Chevrolet", "Nissan", "Volkswagen"}; 
```

## Popcorn Hack 2
``` 
char[] grades = {A, B, A, A, C};
numbers[1] = D;
numbers[2] = A;
numbers[0] = B;

``` 
## Popcorn hack 3:
```
To access all odd indices of the list, you need to change the initial value of index from 0 to 1 in the for loop. This will start iterating from the first odd index (1) and continue incrementing by 2 to access the subsequent odd indices

```
## Popcorn hack 4:

This while loop and the for loop we used earlier accomplish the same task. The main difference is that after the loop is completed, the variable 'index' in the while loop will still exist. The variable 'i' in the for loop will not. Why?

```
In a for loop, the loop variable (i in your case) is created and managed by the loop itself. Once the loop is done, i is discarded or goes out of scope (depending on the language). In some languages like Python, i might persist but with its final value; in other languages like C or Java, the variable is not accessible after the loop ends because it was only declared within the loop's scope.

In contrast, in a while loop, the loop control variable (index in this case) is typically declared outside the loop. Since index exists before the loop begins and isn't tied to the loop's internal mechanics, it will continue to exist after the loop finishes with its current value intact. The while loop doesn't control the creation or destruction of the variable, it just modifies its value during each iteration.
```


### Popcorn Hack 5: 
```
public class GradeAverage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* grades out of 100 */
        int[] grades = {90, 50, 70, 20, 80, 97};
        int sum = 0;
        double average;
        int bonus = 5; // generous bonus points
        
        // Iterate through the list to sum the grades
        for (int i = 0; i < grades.length; i++) {
            sum += grades[i]; 
        }

        // Calculate average
        average = (double) sum / grades.length;
        
        System.out.println("The average of the grades is: " + average);
        
        // Check if the average is below a certain threshold (e.g., 60%)
        if (average < 60) {
            System.out.println("Man, you guys need to study more");
        }

        // Add bonus points to each grade
        System.out.println("Grades after adding bonus points:");
        for (int i = 0; i < grades.length; i++) {
            grades[i] += bonus;
            // Ensure grade does not exceed 100 after bonus
            if (grades[i] > 100) {
                grades[i] = 100;
            }
            System.out.println("Grade " + (i + 1) + ": " + grades[i]);
        }
    }
}

GradeAverage.main(null);
```

## Popcorn Hack 6
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CarSales {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashMap to store car names and their prices
        Map<String, Integer> carMap = new HashMap<String, Integer>();

        // Add car names and prices to the HashMap
        carMap.put("MortMobile", 9999);
        carMap.put("CSAwesomeCar", 500);
        carMap.put("ArrayceCar", 5000);

        // Use a for-each loop to iterate through the HashMap
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : carMap.entrySet()) {
            // Print the car name (key) and the price (value)
            System.out.println("Car Name: " + entry.getKey());
            System.out.println("Price: $" + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}

## Popcorn Hack 7

Final Hack (FIXED)
Finish the following code with a for each and normal for loop
```
int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5,6,2000};

//loop through the array and print if the current index is even
//Sample Solution
int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5,6,2000};

for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
{
    System.out.println(nums[i] % 2 ==0);
}

for(int number : nums)
{
    System.out.println(number % 2 ==0);
}
```

## Popcorn Hack 8

```
private double findMinEven(double [] values) {
    double min = values[0];

    /* enhanced for loop notation /
    for (double value : values) {
        / check for max */
        if (value < min) {
            min = value;
        }
    }
    return min;
}

double[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5,6,2000, 123.123, 1230912839018230.123901823};
System.out.println(findMinEven(nums));
```

## Challenge Hack

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20};
        int shift = 2; // Y = shift
        int space = 4; // X = space

        int[] shifted = shiftRight(numbers, shift, space);
        for (int value : shifted) {
            System.out.print(value + " ");
        }
    }

    private static int[] shiftRight(int[] values, int shift, int space) {
        int[] result = values.clone(); // Clone the array to avoid modifying the original
        int n = values.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % space == 0) { // Check if the index is at the start of every X elements
                for (int j = 0; j < shift; j++) {
                    int indexToMove = (i + j) % n; // Element to be shifted
                    int newIndex = (indexToMove + space - shift) % n; // New index after shifting Y places left
                    if (newIndex < 0) newIndex += n; // Handle negative index wrap-around
                    result[newIndex] = values[indexToMove];
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
Main.main(null)
```
